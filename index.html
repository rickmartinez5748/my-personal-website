    <h1>Hello! I'm Ricardo Martinez</h1>
<p>
I am originally from El Salvador and emigrated to Canada in 2019 in search of new personal and professional opportunities. 
I currently work as a Chemical Engineering Technologist at GeoLabs, under the Ontario Ministry of Mines, 
where I support the preparation and analysis of environmental samples using techniques such as ICP-AES, ICP-OES, 
and Flame Atomic Absorption. I also participate actively in quality assurance processes under ISO 17025, 
including internal audits and continuous improvement initiatives. I have a strong background in laboratory work 
and chemical analysis. 
Outside of work, I am a passionate soccer fan and enjoy reading about history. I believe in lifelong learning and always 
strive to improve myself, I am currently enrolled in a Business Analytics program to strengthen my skills in data analysis 
and stay up to date with emerging technologies in today's job market.
